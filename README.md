# Assignment 4 Reflection
This assignment was definitely a challenge for me. I struggled a lot with getting my images to display at the right size in the Grid layout, and it took some trial and error to make things look balanced without breaking my Flexbox page. Despite the frustration, I really liked learning how Flexbox and Grid help organize content. It’s amazing how much easier layouts are once you understand these tools. I think knowing both of these methods will make future projects way easier and faster to build. If I had to pick, I’d say I prefer Flexbox so far because it was easier to control spacing and alignment without things getting too messy.

I also realized that building in code is a very different experience than just imagining the layout on paper. Sometimes I got stuck or things didn’t look right, but stepping back, adjusting one thing at a time, and previewing my changes helped me stay on track. It was satisfying when small fixes finally made the layout look like I wanted, even if it took longer than I expected. Overall, it taught me patience and how important it is to test frequently while building.
