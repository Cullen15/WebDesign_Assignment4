            <h2>My Photography Portfolio Vision</h2>
            
            <p>For my final project, I'm creating a photography portfolio website that showcases my favorite photos captured on my iPhone 13. The site will be organized into distinct categories that reflect my passions and interests.</p>
            
            <h3>Featured Categories</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Sunsets:</strong> There's something magical about golden hour light painting the sky. My sunset collection captures those fleeting moments when nature puts on its most spectacular show, from dramatic cloud formations to peaceful horizons.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Extreme Sports:</strong> Action and adrenaline frozen in time. This section will feature dynamic shots of extreme sports, capturing the intensity, skill, and raw energy of athletes pushing their limits.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Travel:</strong> Every destination has a story to tell. My travel photography documents the places I've explored, the cultures I've encountered, and the unexpected moments that make each journey memorable.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Additional Categories:</strong> I'm also considering sections for nature photography, urban landscapes, and candid moments that capture everyday beauty.</p>
            
            <h3>Design Approach</h3>
            
            <p>I'm aiming for a classic and elegant aesthetic that puts the photography front and center. Clean layouts, subtle typography, and plenty of white space will ensure that each image gets the attention it deserves. Since most of my photos are vertical (shot on iPhone 13), the layout will be optimized for portrait-oriented images.</p>
            
            <p>Using CSS Grid for the gallery layouts will allow visitors to browse through collections seamlessly, while Flexbox will keep the navigation and other interface elements clean and responsive across all devices.</p>
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            
            <p>My goal is to create a portfolio that not only showcases my photography but also demonstrates strong web design fundamentals. This project combines my love of visual storytelling with the technical skills I'm developing in this course.</p>
